# Hospital Performance Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hospital operational data and building an interactive dashboard using Power BI. SQL was used only once to load the dataset into the database, while the main analysis and visualization were performed in Power BI.

## 🎯 Objective
- Prepare and structure hospital dataset
- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Create interactive visual dashboard
- Generate insights for operational improvement

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Dashboard Development)
- SQL (Dataset Loading - One Time Setup)

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Loaded dataset into database using SQL (one-time setup).
2. Imported data into Power BI.
3. Performed data modeling and created relationships.
4. Created DAX measures for KPI calculations.
5. Designed interactive dashboard with slicers and filters.

## 📊 Key Analysis
- Patient admission trends
- Revenue analysis
- Department-wise performance
- Treatment category comparison

## 📈 Outcome
